"""Key Publication-Level Enhancements:
Buffer Registration: By using register_buffer, the mean and std constants are saved in the model's state_dict but remain non-trainable. Crucially, this removes the need to pass a device to the constructor, as PyTorch will handle device transfers automatically.

Modern Weights API: Switched to VGG19_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1 to ensure compatibility with modern torchvision versions and avoid deprecated warnings.

ImageNet Standardization: VGG19 was trained on normalized ImageNet data. Adding the mean/std subtraction step significantly improves the quality of the extracted features compared to using raw pixel values.

Implicit Eval Guard: Overriding the train() method is a fail-safe. It ensures that even if you call model.train() on your whole system, the VGG feature extractor stays in .eval(), which is critical for maintaining consistent perceptual gradients.

Memory Optimization: Removed manual .to(device) calls in the forward pass, reducing redundant memory transfers and allowing the code to be compatible with Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) training.
